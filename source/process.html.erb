      <h3>LASER ENGRAVING:</h3><p> This process is a laser machine vaporizing material ‘out’ of an area. Used for any material that won’t melt when heat treated and is a very precise method of marking almost anything. It is done with digital art printed through a laser engraver. </p>
      <h3>ROTARY ENGRAVING:</h3><p> We also do rotary engraving with a router type engraver printed digitally through a routering program using different bits to router ‘out’ material. This process is used for anything that can’t be heat treated on a laser or is too thick or cant be cut with a laser. ie: metal </p>
      <h3>SANDBLASTING:</h3><p> This process is done by hand with a blast gun shooting compressed air and blasting medium through a hose at an object that has been covered with rubber mask with the exposed parts being ‘blasted’ out by the sand. </p>

      <h2>Physical Process: </h2>
      <h3>Sandblasting:</h3><p> First we draw the art digitally in an art program which we use for the proofing process as well so customers can see exactly what the art will look like. We then cut out the mask digitally on the laser and ‘weed’ out the parts that are to be recessed. After measuring and marking where the mask will go on the product we then peel the back of the mask to expose the adhesive baking and stick it on. Every part of the product has to be taped using a protective rubber tape so it doesn’t receive any wear from the excess material moving at high speeds in the booth. A blast gun is used to shoot abrasive material and compressed air at very high speed at the object and the places that are exposed are ‘blasted’ out and the rest of the ‘sand’ bounces off the rubber and tape where it is not to be marked. We minimize dust by blasting in a tent with a dust collection system when we are on-site to avoid any excess dust on the property along with tarps and boards to not disturb the ground in any way. There is a dust collection system installed to collect the dust when we are blasting in-house as well. The on-site process takes about 1 hour given no issues for one stone.

      <h3>Laser Engraving:</h3><p> The easy way to understand the laser engraving process is, it’s just like printing on a regular printer but instead of different inks, you print with percentage of power (100% of the whatever power your laser is), speed (that the printhead travels at) and frequency (the amount of times the laser shoots per second). This is all determined by the percentage of black in a picture so everything has to be printed in greyscale. Instead of paper you can put just about anything in the machine! We print on metal, plastic, glass, stone, wood, rubber, fabric, foam, paper, ceramic, fiberglass or pretty much anything you can think of. We have even done cookies, apples and bananas and of course pumpkins at Halloween! We set up the art digitally in an art program which is printed to a driver that controls the engraver. The laser is produced from a CO2 cartridge turning through a series of mirrors and lenses to essentially vaporize the material its being printed on. The laser head does not actually touch the material so it does not have to be taped or held down in any way other than if it will be displaced by the suction of the exhaust flowing through the machine. You can very easily burn something with a laser if you have either the wrong settings or you don’t know what you are doing. You also need to know where the laser is going to land since you have a large table and different sized objects on it so almost everything has to be test printed before running the real job. There are 2 different types of laser engraving as well, there is ‘raster engraving’ where the head travels back and forth on one plane on the x-axis as it is focused to the material very accurately and takes out blocks of material. The other is ‘vector cutting’ which is where the head travels on one plane but a combination of x and y axis travel allowing it to cut in all directions. The timing for any different job is very different when lasering depending on the material. For a typical order to be done we try to process them in a week. If there are any issues with materials or other factors you will be notified.  
      Rotary Engraving: This utilizes different cutting bits to literally carve out material and is known as the ‘old’ way of engraving but still very useful in some instances. The art is set up through a digital art program but specific to the routering format. Material is laid out on a table but has to be held in place either by a jig, tape or vice so it doesn’t move when the bit touches it. The bits come in different sizes and materials so there are many of them. The different bit sizes will give you a different line width depending on the pressure you apply downward on the bit. You can also set the speed the head travels at and the spindle RPM for harder or softer materials and to finish edges in a certain way. We use this machine to cut out thicker metal and some plastics that are non-engravable or have a low acrylic content and therefore melt when treated with the high heat of a laser engraver.</p>
